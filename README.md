# Anyshift
## A simple python app to convert joystick inputs into key strokes so you can play vintage driving games with a H-Shifter

Anyshift is a software written in Python. It uses pygame (https://www.pygame.org/news) joystick  module to read inputs from the selected device and transform them into key presses so you can use your  
H-Shifter with your favorite old sim.

### How to use AnyShift

You can uncompress Anyshift in any directory you want. Included in the .rar comes an ini file that can be edited manually but it is preferable that you run 'config.exe' so you know exactly wich id has your shifter assigned. You can choose wich joystick is used to select gears, wich keys are pressed for upshift and downshift, and if you want the gear to be neutral if there is no gear selected in the shifter (this wonÂ´t work in old games, but i included the option, just in case)
