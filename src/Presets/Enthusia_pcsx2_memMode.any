[OPTIONS]
; true if you have a shifter with seven gears. seventh gear button must be configured or anyshift will crash 
seven gears = False
; true if you want to change to neutral if no gear is selected in shifter. most old games doesnt support this
neutral detection = False
; time the shifter must stay in neutral to engage it
neutral delay = 0.5
; true if clutch is needed to change gears
require clutch = True
; percent of the clutch that needs to be pressed to allow gear change
clutch bitepoint = 75
; true if the game uses a separated button for reverse. gran turismo or nascar racing for example
reverse is button = False
; unique mode for old papyrus games where the game remember the gear you were in when you changed to
; reverse. this will change all way down to first gear and then press reverse to avoid desynchronization
nascar racing mode = False
; instead of key presses it writes data to memory. i only included it because of grand prix 2
; each game has different memory values. no offical support for this one
