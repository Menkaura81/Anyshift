; this is the id number of the shifter you want to use

; this is the id number of the controller you wanth to use for clutch
clutch id = 2
; selected controller axis for the clutch

; joystick buttons for each gear
first gear = 0
second gear = 1

sixth gear = 5
seventh gear = 6
reverse = 7

[KEYS]
; upshift, downshift, neutral and reverse key
upshift = s
downshift = z
reverse = c
neutral key = n

[OPTIONS]
; true if you have a shifter with seven gears. seventh gear button must be configured or anyshift will crash 
seven gears = True
; true if you want to change to neutral if no gear is selected in shifter. most old games doesnt support this
neutral detection = False
; true if clutch is needed to change gears
require clutch = True
; true if the game uses a separated button for reverse. gran turismo or nascar racing for example
reverse is button = True
; unique mode for old papyrus games where the game remember the gear you were in when you changed to
; reverse. this will change all way down to first gear and then press reverse to avoid desynchronization
nascar racing mode = False
; instead of key presses it writes data to memory. i only included it because of grand prix 2
; each game has different memory values. no offical support for this one
memory write mode = True
; name of the process of the game
process name = RichardBurnsRally_SSE.exe
; base address. ex: 0.74 = 0x01d3a1a0 
base address = 0x8EF660
; memory value offset from base addres

; delays for key presses and releases. tinker with this if game doesnt detect key presses
